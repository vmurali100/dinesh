    <p>
      <strong>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy</strong> text of the printing and
      <sub>typesetting industry</sub>. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
      standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
      galley of type and <b>scrambled</b> it to make a type specimen book. It
      has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
      <em>electronic typesetting</em>, remaining essentially
      <sup>unchanged</sup>. It was popularised in the <del>1960s</del> with the
      release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem <ins>Ipsum passages</ins>, and
      more recently with <i>desktop publishing software</i> like Aldus
      <mark>PageMaker</mark> including <small>versions of Lorem Ipsum</small>.
